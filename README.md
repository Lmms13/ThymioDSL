# Thymio DSL

This is a high level domain specific language to program Thymio robots. It was created to be easy to use by people who have no experience in programming.
The JAR is the compiler, which turns Thymio DSL code from .thymio files into aseba code, which can be injected into the robots (you may test it using Thymio Suite).
To launch an instance of an editor that supports this language, I recommend using Eclipse Modeling Tools, installing Xtext and running the root project as a Java Application.

If you have issues importing the project, I suggest reading the README.pdf file. It's in Portuguese but it may still be perceptible.
There is also a user manual to get acquainted with the Thymio DSL language.
